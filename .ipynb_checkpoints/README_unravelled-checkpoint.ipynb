    "\n",
    "#### Data Scinece Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Can a model be constructed that picks the winner with at least 75% accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct any model that will predict with at least 75% accuracy the winner in any division 1 football game given current data about the teams.  The goal of the model will be to generate a probability of victory for each of two competing teams in order to determine the team that is more likely to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a list of all division 1 college football teams.\n",
    "1. Obtain basic lifetime stats for each team in the list of Division 1 teams.  (Basic stats include: win-loss-tie record or win percentage, average offensive yards per game, average points per game, average number of touchdowns per game, average number of defensive tackles per game, average number of possessions per game, average number of fieldgoals per game, average number of points allowed, average number of yards allowed, etc.)\n",
    "1. Obtain the same stats as above, but for only the last 7 years.  The belief is that the near past performence, as opposed to the historical performence, of any given team will be a better predictor of success in current game play.  Seven years will act as a starting point for exploring the ambiguous concept of \"near past.\"\n",

    "A few notes regarding the primary dataset used for modeling:\n",
    "1. The primary dataset for analysis to answer the data science questions is labeled [data_for_analysis](https://github.com/BlakeWallace/Project_Pigskin/blob/master/Data/data_for_analysis.csv).  \n",
    "1. When reading through a notebook, any data that is put into this dataset is labeled `'stuff_to_keep'`.  Once this point is reached inside a notebook, the data that follows is munged, cleaned, engineered, or explored to be included in the primary dataset for analysis.  In all cases the data is later renamed to be included to the [data_for_analysis](https://github.com/BlakeWallace/Project_Pigskin/blob/master/Data/data_for_analysis.csv) dataset.\n",
